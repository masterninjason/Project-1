    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        \{project \#1\} is a small tactical game for 3 players, where every turn counts, balance attacking and defending, and utilizing every positional detail and sometimes a little teamwork to your advantage to claim victory
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Setup}
        \raggedright
        First set up your board as shown below and designate a corner for each player's 'Base'
        \includegraphics[]{Img/3DuelBoard.png}
        \newline
        then place each of the players character and weapon in their corner, with their weapon in the corner space. choose a player to start, then begin!
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Winning}
        The goal of the game is to get a point from each of your opponents. you get a point by either knocking them out or entering their base.
        \newline
        example: the red player knocked out the blue player, then enters the base of the green player, they win.
    \end{block}


    \begin{block}{On your Turn}
        On your turn, you must make a move if possible, if no possible moves exist, your turn is skipped. most moves can be categorized in 2 ways, Attacks, and Movements. an attack does not move your character, but knocks out an opponent. you must successfully knock out an opponent to take an attack action, if an action moves your character, it does not have to successfully attack and can be considered a movement
    \end{block}

\end{column}


\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth - 1.5cm}

    \begin{block}{Basic move}
        Move your character to any adjacent space
        then place your weapon in any space adjacent to your character.
        you may not place ether in a space already occupied by an opponent's character or weapon.
        you may move into the space containing your own weapon.
        you do not have to move your weapon as long as it is still in an adjacent space
        alternatively, you may take your weapon completely off the board and "sheath" it, meaning you wont be able to attack next turn, but can take a run action
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Run}
        If you start your turn with your weapon "sheathed" (off the board) you may move 2 spaces, then place your weapon in an adjacent space (or keep it sheathed)
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Jump}
        you may "jump" over your weapon, leaving it in the same position, but moving your character to the opposite side,
        this can be used as a movement or an attack, knocking out the player on the opposite side
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Swing}
        you may stay in the same spot, knocking out a player by placing your weapon in their space, you may "swing" your weapon upto 2 spaces, remaining adjacent to you. you may not move your weapon through an opponents weapon, or "spaces" off the board
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Getting knocked out}
        if you are knocked out, you are not out of the game, simply remove your pieces from the board, then on your next turn place them back in tour starting position, if there are already any pieces there, move them to the next closest empty space, if there are multiple options, the player getting moved has the choice
    \end{block}
